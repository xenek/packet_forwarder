# Packet Forwarder

Packet forwarder to make the link between a LoRa concentrator and [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org)'s backend.

This packet forwarder **isn't destined** to [The Things Gateway](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/gateway/)'s users, but for users who **already have a gateway** from another vendor, and that want to connect it to The Things Network.
